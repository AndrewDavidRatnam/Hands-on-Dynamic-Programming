Problem Statement: Frog Jump with Minimum Cost
A frog is trying to cross a line of stones. Each stone is at a certain height, represented by the array heights. The frog initially at the first stone and aims to reach the last stone with the minimum total cost.

The cost to jump from one stone to another is the absolute difference in their heights. The frog can jump to:

1. The next stone, or
2. The next-to-next stone.
Write a function minCost(heights) that returns the minimum total cost for the frog to reach the last stone.

Example:
Input:

heights = [10, 30, 40, 20]
Output:

30
Explanation:

The frog jumps from the first stone (height 10) to the second stone (height 30), and then to the fourth stone (height 20).

Jump costs:

From 10 to 30: |30 - 10| = 20
From 30 to 20: |30 - 20| = 10
Total cost: 20 + 10 = 30.

# Longest Decreasing Susequence(LDS)

**Find the length of Longest Decreasing Subsequence(LDS) of given list, where the subsequence elements are highest to lowest.**

Note:- All elements are distinct.

**Write a function longest_decreasing_sequence(L) that accepts list of L values and returns the length of longest decreasing subsequence.
**
Example

L = [20, 15, 8, 12, 2]

Here longest decreasing subsequence is [20, 15, 8, 2] and it's length is 4.

Input 1

[20,15,8,12,2]
Output

4
Input 2

[5,10,3]
Output

2

# Problem Statement: Resource Allocation in Projects

You are given n projects, where each project i requires a cost cost[i] and yields a profit profit[i]. You have a maximum budget B. Determine the maximum profit you can achieve without exceeding the budget.

**Write a function maxProfit(cost, profit, B) that returns the maximum profit you can achieve without exceeding the budget.**

## Example:

**Input:**

cost = [1, 3, 4, 5]
profit = [10, 40, 50, 70]
B = 8

**Output:**
110

**Explanation:**

By selecting projects with costs 3 and 5 (profits 40 and 70), the total profit is 110, which is the maximum achievable without exceeding the budget of 8.

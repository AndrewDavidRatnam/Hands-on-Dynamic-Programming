# Problem Statement: Longest Palindromic Subsequence

**Given a string s, find the length of the longest subsequence of s that is a palindrome.**

Write a function longestPalindromicSubsequence(s) that returns the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.

Note: A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Example:

**Input:**
s = "bbabcbcab"

**Output:**
7

Explanation: The longest palindromic subsequence is "babcbab" or "bacbcab", both of length 7.

## Problem Statement: Maximum Sum of Non-Adjacent Numbers

Given an array of integers arr, find the maximum sum of elements such that no two selected elements are adjacent.

Write a function maxSum(arr) that returns the maximum sum of elements such that no two selected elements are adjacent.

## Example:

Input:

arr = [3, 2, 7, 10]
Output:

13


## Explanation:

Selecting 3 and 10 gives a sum of 3 + 10 = 13.
Other combinations like 2 + 7 = 9 result in a smaller sum.
Adjacent elements cannot be selected.
